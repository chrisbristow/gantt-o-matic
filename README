Draw Gantt charts in a web page.

- Create task definitions in JSON.
- Tasks can commence at:
  - a fixed start date.
  - aligned with the start date of another task.
  - dependent on the completion date of a list of other tasks.
  - spanning a set of other tasks.
- Time is allocated in days, but a weekly summary can also be plotted.

Ganttish (todo):

[Spanning task
2024-09-17
- 5:First task starts a a given date
- 2:Second task aligned with first task

- 4:Third task after first task and second task

- 3:Fourth task after third task
]

If within a spanning task:
- The spanning task sits at level 0
- Tasks within the spanning task sit at level 1

If not:
- All tasks sit at level 0

Suggested Planning Workflow
===========================

1) Planning an end date:
- Don't specify a start date
- Add all tasks (sequential or aligned)
- Current end date is shown

2) When a start date has been agreed:
- Add the start date
- Start dates in the past are usually meaningless unless work has already started

3) If phases are needed, add spanning tasks:
- All sequential tasks will move to level 1
- Spanning tasks (phases) will appear at level 0
